# A Web Crawler With asyncio Coroutines

It's a git repo with code samples based on 
["Web crawler"](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/tree/master/crawler) chapter from 
["500 Lines or Less"](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines).

It uses an incremental approach, so you can follow along the chapter and run code samples with verbose logging.

Uses Docker and Python 3.6.
